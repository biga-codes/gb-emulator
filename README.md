# Emulator for the Game Boy Advance
This is a simple emulator for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance (GBA) gaming console. It’s still a work in progress, but the main goal is just to figure out how emulation actually works by trying to rebuild the GBA’s hardware in code. this is meant as a learning project as a foray into computer architecture, low-level programming and reverse engineering, using software to mimic real hardware behavior

I used Codeslinger’s emulator tutorials as a reference point, along with GBA hardware docs
